# Snook Chat
## Introduction
This repo contains both a chat application and a server hosting it. 
## Technologies
Go,
WebSockets
## Installation
Lorem ipsum
## What's the plan?
The plan is to make a modular chat application that makes it possible for user to communicate in different environments. The server and application should be built as open as possible. The
purpose of this is to make it possible to develop modules for the application, in a pursuit of making it easier to make different clients able to connect and use it. Examples of this could
be that a user using Snook on the web in a simple way can communicate with his friend using Snook through the command-line for example. 
## How? 
The core is the server-implementation building on WebSockets. The client right now is connecting through the command-line Go implementation.
## Why Go?
Its fast, reliable and Segelfartyg personally do want to learn it :) 

## General TODO:s 
Web Client, chat-rooms, pass-phrases, Docker implementation for easier deployments, fun addons to the cmd client.
